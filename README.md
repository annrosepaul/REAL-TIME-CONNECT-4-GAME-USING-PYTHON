# REAL-TIME-CONNECT-4-GAME-USING-PYTHON
This project consisted of creating a pygame using python for the game Connect 4. 
We created code that set up a 5 by 5 board.
Two players play against each other: PLAYER-1 v/s PLAYER-2 
The player hovers the mouse over the board and then clicks on any column and their chip will fall to the appropriate row. This means that if there are no chips in that column, it will fall to the row directly occupying the lower, upper ,left or right available space.
